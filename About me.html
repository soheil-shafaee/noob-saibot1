    <p><font face="Mongolian Baiti">Noob Saibot<strong style="color:Aquamarine">, once known as Bi-Han (壁寒)and the Elder Sub-Zero,
        is a Lin Kuei assassin turned wraith in the Mortal Kombat fighting game
        series. Bi-Han made his debut as one of the few original characters in the
        first Mortal Kombat game as the original Sub-Zero, a mantle later passed
        down to his younger brother Kuai Liang after his death. He later reappears
        as the Elder Sub-Zero in Mortal Kombat. Bi-Han made his debut as
        Noob Saibotin Mortal Kombat II as a secret character, a role he takes on
        in many games after before making his playable debut in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
        However, the identiy of Noob Saibot being Bi-Han
        was not established until Mortal Kombat: Deception. He reappears as Noob Saibot in Mortal Kombat and Mortal
        Kombat 11.After his death and resurrection as Noob Saibot, he has been a recurring
        antagonist in the franchise, usually siding with other characters on the side of
        evil in a bid to benefit himself. He also serves as a major antagonist towards his
        younger brother and Scorpion in many instances. to prevent Scorpion from murdering the first Sub-Zero by offering to ask the Elder Gods to resurrect the Shirai Ryu. This fails when the sorcerer Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion with a vision of
        Bi-Han murdering his family. After his death, Bi-Han is subsequently resurrected by Quan Chi to serve as one of his undead revenant enforcers.Saibot supports Quan Chi and Shao Kahn, while also keeping in touch with the Cyber Lin Kuei, who had
        joined the latter's forces as well. Although he first appears during the second Mortal Kombat tournament, he does not receive a significant role until Outworld invades Earthrealm. He is sent to defend Quan Chi's Soulnado from Earthrealm's
        protectors, only to be defeated by his younger brother, who became the new Sub-Zero, and launched into the Soulnado by Earthrealm warrior Nightwolf, which dissipates the Soulnado and seemingly kills Saibot.
        Saibot returns in Mortal Kombat 11, having mysteriously survived the Soulnado and acquired amplified powers. Hiding in the shadows for years, Quan Chi's death in Mortal Kombat X frees Saibot from enslavement. After the keeper of time Kronika,
        merges the past and present timelines, Noob pledged his allegiance to her in return for a dark clan of his own. He assists a time-displaced Sektor and a cyberized Frost in kidnapping Lin Kuei clansmen and converting them into cyborg warriors
        before attempting to stop the newly allied Scorpion and Sub-Zero from foiling their plans, only to be defeated and forced to retreat with Sektor's deactivated body. He reappears on Shang Tsung's island to stop Jax and Jacqui Briggs from
        retrieving Kronika's crown, but is defeated once again. Due to Shang Tsung’s interference in Aftermath expansion storyline, Noob instead appears alongside a reluctant present-Jax at a same time where they fought Fujin and Shang Tsung. Noob is
        defeated by the Wind God in their rematch when they recall their first fight two decades ago. As revealed in Sub-Zero's ending, Sektor corrupted Bi-Han before he became Saibot.
